## Commonsense-Validation
This is from the task 1 of the paper [Does it make sense? ACL, 2019](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1393/)
<br>
This work should be done by three people but I only put my part of work here, for the their work behaved very poorly. 
<br>
In my work, I use the state of art model Bert to do classification, and achieves an accuracy of 82.40\%.
<br>
The code was referred to the documentation file and templates of [transformers in pytorch](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers).
