    1. File "Dic_to_Txt.py" is the code to count unigram and bigram, 
then save them in the corresponding txt file.
    2. File "unigram.txt" and "bigram.txt" are output by 1. and will be used in
"program.py".
    3. File "eval.py","vocab.txt". "testdata.txt" and "ans.txt" are original files.
    4. File "count_1edit.txt" is downloaded from online. It is used as the 
confusion matrix to build channel model.
    5. File "vocab.txt" is the original vocabulary file.
    6. File "result.txt" is the file that "program.py" output.
    7. File "program.py" is the main function of my project.
        Note: due to the Interpolation smoothing method outperforms other
three methods, so I comment other three methods' function out.
