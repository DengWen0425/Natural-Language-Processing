##The following is a breif description of all the files:
  * File "Dic_to_Txt.py" is the code to count unigram and bigram, then save them in the corresponding txt file.
  * File "unigram.txt" and "bigram.txt" are output by 1. and will be used in "program.py".
  * File "eval.py","vocab.txt". "testdata.txt" and "ans.txt" are original files.
  * File "count_1edit.txt" is downloaded from online. It is used as the 
confusion matrix to build channel model.
  * File "vocab.txt" is the original vocabulary file. 
  * 6. File "result.txt" is the file that "program.py" output.
  * 7. File "program.py" is the main function of my project.

  Note: due to the Interpolation smoothing method outperforms other three methods, so I comment other three methods' function out.
